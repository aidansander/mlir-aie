    Baseline test on manually software pipelined dut_inlined.cc END_TITLE

MID_EDITS: None

FILE_FLOW(dut_inlined.ll): dut_inlined.cc -(peano clang)-> dut_inlined.ll
FILE_FLOW(lut_based_ops.ll): /path/to/aie_runtime_lib/AIE2/lut_based_ops.cpp -(peano clang)-> lut_based_ops.ll


NOTES:
dut_inlined.cc is the result of manually inlining the call to getExpbf16() and then manually software pipelining,
by using intermediate variables to force operations that consume load results (mmul, casting) to occur one loop
iteration later than the load itself - see dut_inlined.cc for this in practice.

    Added accumulator to accumulate matmul results into instead of storing results - this should prevent matmul from being optimized outEND_TITLE

MID_EDITS: None

FILE_FLOW(dut_inlined.ll): dut_inlined.cc -(peano clang)-> dut_inlined.ll
FILE_FLOW(lut_based_ops.ll): /path/to/aie_runtime_lib/AIE2/lut_based_ops.cpp -(peano clang)-> lut_based_ops.ll


NOTES:
Despite the fact that the newly added register is an accumulator (only 1 accum used before), the changes caused a bunch of register spilling.
